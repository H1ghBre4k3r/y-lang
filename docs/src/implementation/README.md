# Compiler Implementation

This section provides detailed technical documentation for the Y language compiler implementation. These documents are intended for compiler developers, contributors, and those interested in understanding how Y works at a low level.

## Overview

The Y compiler is implemented in Rust and follows a traditional multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Lexing/Parsing**: Tree-sitter based parsing with AST generation
2. **Type Checking**: Type inference, semantic analysis, and validation
3. **Code Generation**: LLVM IR generation and optimization

## Key Implementation Features

### Modern Architecture
- **Type-Safe AST**: Generic AST nodes with compile-time type information
- **Incremental Parsing**: Tree-sitter enables fast re-parsing for language servers
- **Memory Safe**: Rust implementation prevents common compiler bugs

### Advanced Features
- **Closures**: Full variable capture with heap-allocated environments
- **Type Inference**: Powerful type deduction reduces annotation requirements
- **LLVM Backend**: Leverages mature optimization infrastructure

### Performance Characteristics
- **Fast Compilation**: Efficient pipeline with minimal passes
- **Optimal Code**: LLVM generates highly optimized machine code
- **Memory Efficiency**: Careful resource management throughout compilation

## Documentation Organization

### Optimization
Performance optimizations applied during compilation and runtime considerations.

## Contributing

If you're contributing to the Y compiler:

1. **Read the Architecture Overview** first to understand the big picture
2. **Follow the established patterns** in AST design and error handling
3. **Update documentation** when adding new features or changing implementations
4. **Add tests** for both user-facing features and internal components

## Development Setup

See the main project README for development environment setup. Key tools:

- **Rust toolchain**: Latest stable Rust
- **LLVM**: Version 15+ with development headers
- **Tree-sitter**: For grammar development
- **Just**: Build system automation

## Design Principles

The Y compiler follows these core principles:

### Correctness First
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Comprehensive error checking at compile time
- Clear error messages with helpful suggestions

### Performance Matters
- Zero-cost abstractions where possible
- Efficient memory layout and algorithms
- Leverage LLVM's optimization expertise

### Developer Experience
- Fast compilation for rapid iteration
- Excellent IDE integration via language server
- Clear, actionable error messages

### Maintainability
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Comprehensive testing at all levels
- Self-documenting code with good abstractions

These implementation documents provide the technical depth needed to understand, maintain, and extend the Y compiler effectively.
