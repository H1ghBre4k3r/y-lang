# Implementation

This section covers the implementation details of the Y programming language, focusing on code generation using Inkwell and LLVM. Each page provides comprehensive examples with conceptual explanations.

## Overview

Y Lang is implemented using Rust and leverages LLVM for code generation through the Inkwell library. The implementation follows a traditional compiler pipeline:

1. **Lexing** - Tokenizing source code using pattern matching and regex
2. **Parsing** - Building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with grammar-driven development
3. **Type Checking** - Two-phase semantic analysis with dependency resolution
4. **Code Generation** - Converting typed AST to LLVM IR using Inkwell

## Design Philosophy

The code generation focuses on:

- **Clarity over Performance**: Readable LLVM IR generation that can be optimized later
- **Type Safety**: Leveraging LLVM's type system to catch errors early
- **Debugging Support**: Generating meaningful names and structured IR
- **Extensibility**: Patterns that can accommodate future language features

## Reading This Documentation

Each section builds upon previous concepts:
- Start with **Foundation Concepts** to understand LLVM basics
- Progress through the sections in order for comprehensive understanding
- Reference **Complete Examples** to see how concepts combine
- Use individual sections as reference material for specific constructs

The examples focus on the "why" behind implementation decisions, not just the "how".
