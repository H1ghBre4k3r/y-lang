# Advanced Features

This section covers advanced language features in Y that provide additional flexibility and integration capabilities for complex programming scenarios.

## Overview

Y includes several advanced features that go beyond basic programming constructs:

- **Constants** - Compile-time constant values that cannot be changed
- **External Declarations** - Interface with external libraries and system functions
- **Type Annotations** - Explicit type specifications for complex scenarios

## Constants

Constants in Y are immutable values known at compile time. They're useful for configuration values, mathematical constants, and other unchanging data:

```why
const PI: f64 = 3.1415;
const MAX_USERS: i64 = 1000;
const DEBUG_MODE: bool = true;
```

## External Declarations

The `declare` keyword allows you to interface with external functions, typically from C libraries or system functions:

```why
declare printf: (str) -> void;
declare malloc: (i64) -> void;
declare strlen: (str) -> i64;
```

## Type Annotations

While Y has type inference, explicit type annotations provide clarity and are required in certain contexts:

```why
let processor: (str) -> bool = validate_input;
let numbers: &[i64] = &[];
let complex_type: ((i64) -> bool, &[str]) -> i64 = process_data;
```

## Integration Features

These advanced features work together to enable:
- **System Integration** - Interfacing with operating system functions
- **Library Integration** - Using external C libraries
- **Performance Optimization** - Compile-time constants for better optimization
- **Type Safety** - Explicit type checking for complex function signatures

## Example Usage

```why
// Constants for configuration
const BUFFER_SIZE: i64 = 1024;
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: f64 = 30.0;

// External system functions
declare malloc: (i64) -> void;
declare free: (void) -> void;

// Complex type annotations
let data_processor: (str, (str) -> bool) -> &[str] = filter_strings;

fn main(): void {
    // Using constants
    let buffer = create_buffer(BUFFER_SIZE);

    // Using external functions
    malloc(BUFFER_SIZE);

    // Using complex types
    let filtered = data_processor("input", \(s) => is_valid(s));
}
```

These features enable Y to be both a high-level language with good abstractions and a systems programming language that can integrate closely with existing infrastructure.
